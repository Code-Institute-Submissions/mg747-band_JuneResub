-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are Code Insititue black, and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Helvetica and Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arial is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The Hero Image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        2. The band name is on the top left of the navigation bar as the site header, when clicked on; it returns the user back to the Home page of the site.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their fans think of them and know why they are so successful. I also want to locate their social media links to see their followers.

        1. These are clearly shown underneath the Hero Image. To the left is an Album cover of the Band new music. Underneath the album cover, there is a music video.
        2. To the right is a stage photo with text about upcoming show in Dublin and a buy tickets button that will redirect a user to the Official Ticket site to purchase tickets. 
    
    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the band with any questions I may have.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily see this information at the bottom right, underneath the Hero Image.
        2. There is also a table at the bottom of the Home page for more information about upcoming shows and tickets availability.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

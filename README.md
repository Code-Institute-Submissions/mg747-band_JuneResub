    -   #### Typography
        -   The Arial font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Helvetica and Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Arial is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.

        2. To the right is a banner about upcoming show in Dublin with a buy tickets button that will direct a user to the Tour page for more information about upcoming shows and tickets availability.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the band with any questions I may have.
